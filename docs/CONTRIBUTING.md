## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always work on a separate branch:

# Sync with upstream
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Changes

Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards) while making changes:

```bash
# Make your changes
# ...

# Test your changes locally
npm run dev

# Check types
npm run type-check

# Format code (if configured)
npm run format

# Run linter (if configured)
npm run lint
```

### 3. Commit Changes

Follow our [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines):

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional commit message
git commit -m "feat(services): add booking functionality to service pages"
```

### 4. Push Changes

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Pull Request"
3. Select base branch (usually `develop`)
4. Fill out the PR template
5. Submit for review

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use explicit types for parameters
function getService(id: string): Promise<Service> {
  return fetch(`/api/services/${id}`).then(res => res.json())
}

// ‚úÖ Use interfaces for object shapes
interface ServiceProps {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
}

// ‚úÖ Avoid 'any' type
// ‚ùå function process(data: any) {}
// ‚úÖ function process(data: unknown) {}

// ‚úÖ Use type inference when obvious
const count = 5 // Inferred as number
const name = 'UAE Digital' // Inferred as string
```

### React Components

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use functional components
export function ServiceCard({ service }: ServiceCardProps) {
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}

// ‚úÖ Server Components by default
export default async function ServicesPage() {
  const services = await getServices()
  return <ServicesList services={services} />
}

// ‚úÖ Add 'use client' only when needed
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export function InteractiveComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false)
  return <button onClick={() => setState(!state)}>Toggle</button>
}

// ‚úÖ Extract complex logic to custom hooks
export function useWindowSize() {
  // Hook logic
}
```

### Styling with Tailwind

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use Tailwind utility classes
<div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">

// ‚úÖ Use cn() utility for conditional classes
<button className={cn(
  'px-4 py-2 rounded',
  isActive && 'bg-blue-600',
  isDisabled && 'opacity-50'
)}>

// ‚úÖ Extract repeated patterns to components
// Instead of repeating:
<div className="rounded-lg border p-6 shadow-sm">
// Create:
<Card>

// ‚úÖ Mobile-first responsive design
<div className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">

// ‚ùå Avoid arbitrary values when possible
<div className="w-[234px]"> // Use design system values

// ‚úÖ Use design system values
<div className="w-56">
```

### File Organization

```typescript
// Component file structure:

// 1. Imports - External
import { useState } from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

// 2. Imports - Internal absolute
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button'
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/utils'

// 3. Imports - Relative
import { ServiceCard } from './ServiceCard'

// 4. Types
import type { Service } from '@/types/service'

// 5. Component
export function ServicesList({ services }: Props) {
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}
```

### Naming Conventions

```typescript
// Components - PascalCase
ServiceCard, UserProfile, BookingForm

// Functions - camelCase
getServices, formatDate, handleSubmit

// Variables - camelCase
userName, isLoading, hasError

// Constants - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
API_BASE_URL, MAX_ITEMS, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

// Types/Interfaces - PascalCase
interface Service {}
type ServiceStatus = 'active' | 'inactive'

// Files - kebab-case (folders and non-component files)
service-card.test.ts, use-window-size.ts

// Component files - PascalCase
ServiceCard.tsx, UserProfile.tsx
```

## Review Process

### What to Expect

1. **Initial Review**: Within 1-3 business days
2. **Feedback**: Constructive comments and suggestions
3. **Iterations**: You may need to make changes
4. **Approval**: At least one approval required
5. **Merge**: After approval and passing CI checks

### Responding to Feedback

**When you receive feedback:**
- Read comments carefully
- Ask questions if unclear
- Make requested changes
- Comment when changes are made
- Be professional and respectful

**Example responses:**
```markdown
‚úÖ "Good catch! Fixed in latest commit."
‚úÖ "I've updated the component as suggested. Let me know if it looks better."
‚úÖ "I'm not sure I understand this comment. Could you elaborate?"
‚úÖ "I considered this approach, but went with X because Y. Thoughts?"

‚ùå "This is fine as is."

‚ùå "Whatever, changing it."
```

### Reviewer Guidelines

**When reviewing PRs:**
- Be constructive and specific
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work
- Focus on code, not the person
- Approve when ready, even if minor suggestions remain
- Be timely with reviews

**Example review comments:**
```markdown
‚úÖ "This component could be more performant if we memoize it with React.memo, 
   since it's re-rendering on every parent update."

‚úÖ "Great work on the accessibility! One suggestion: could we add 
   aria-label to the icon button for screen readers?"

‚úÖ "Nice solution! Consider extracting this logic to a custom hook 
   for reusability."

‚ùå "This is wrong."
‚ùå "Why did you do it this way?"
‚ùå "Bad code."
```
