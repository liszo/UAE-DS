## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Add More Testimonials/Case Studies

**Example to add to service data files:**

```typescript
testimonials: [
  {
    quote: 'First testimonial...',
    author: 'Name 1',
    role: 'Role',
    company: 'Company',
    location: 'Dubai',
    results: 'Key result'
  },
  {
    quote: 'Second testimonial...',
    author: 'Name 2',
    role: 'Role',
    company: 'Company',
    location: 'Abu Dhabi',
    results: 'Key result'
  },
  {
    quote: 'Third testimonial...',
    author: 'Name 3',
    role: 'Role',
    company: 'Company',
    location: 'Dubai',
    results: 'Key result'
  },
],
caseStudies: [
  // Add at least 3 case studies too
]
```

### 2. Replace Video URLs
Update each service data file with actual NotebookLM video URLs:

```typescript
videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID'
```

### 3. Create OG Images (Optional)
Create social sharing images (1200√ó630px) and save to:
```
public/og-images/[service-slug].jpg
```
