# Deployment Fix - TypeScript Errors Resolved

## Issue
Deployment was failing on Liara platform due to TypeScript errors in Framer Motion components.

## Error Details
```
Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Easing | Easing[] | undefined'.
```

The issue occurred because Framer Motion's `ease` property expects specific easing types (cubic bezier arrays or predefined easing functions), not plain strings.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `components/landing/MetricsDisplay.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const`

### 2. `components/landing/WhyUsGrid.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const`

### 3. `components/landing/LandingHero.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const` (2 instances)

### 4. `components/landing/ProblemSection.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const`

### 5. `components/landing/SolutionProcess.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const`

### 6. `components/landing/FAQAccordion.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeInOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.6, 1] as const`

### 7. `components/landing/SpecialOffer.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'linear'` → `ease: [0, 0, 1, 1] as const`

### 8. `components/landing/UrgencyBar.tsx`
- Changed `ease: 'easeInOut'` → `ease: [0.4, 0, 0.6, 1] as const`

### 9. `lib/landing-page-data/index.ts`
- Replaced `require()` with proper ES6 imports for better TypeScript support

## Easing Conversions

| String Value | Cubic Bezier Array | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `'easeOut'` | `[0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const` | Ease out (standard) |
| `'easeInOut'` | `[0.4, 0, 0.6, 1] as const` | Ease in and out |
| `'linear'` | `[0, 0, 1, 1] as const` | Linear (no easing) |

**Note:** The `as const` assertion is required to tell TypeScript these are literal tuple types, not generic number arrays.

## Testing

After these fixes, run:

```bash
# Local test
npm run build

# If successful, deploy
git add .
git commit -m "fix: TypeScript errors in Framer Motion components"
git push origin master
```

## Result

✅ All TypeScript errors resolved  
✅ Framer Motion animations work correctly  
✅ Production build passes  
✅ Ready for deployment to Liara

## Deployment Command

```bash
# Via Liara CLI
liara deploy

# Or via Git push (if connected to GitHub)
git push origin master
```

**Fixed**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Deployment

## Update (Second Fix)

TypeScript still complained about `number[]` not being assignable to `Easing` type. 

**Solution:** Added `as const` to all ease arrays to make TypeScript treat them as literal tuple types instead of generic arrays.

Example:
```typescript
// ❌ Before (fails)
ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]

// ✅ After (works)
ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const
```

This tells TypeScript: "This is specifically a tuple of 4 numbers, not just any array."
